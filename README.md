# Automatic-Mop-and-Vacuum-Robot

A hybrid floor-cleaning robot that automates both *mopping* and *vacuuming* using Arduino Mega, sensors, and Bluetooth control.  
Designed as a *smart and cost-effective home cleaning solution* for modern households, it supports *manual (Bluetooth)* and *automatic (sensor-based)* modes.

## ⚙ Key Features
- Dual-mode operation: Manual via smartphone app, Automatic via sensors  
- Ultrasonic and IR sensors for obstacle and edge detection  
- Vacuum motor for dry cleaning, rotating mop for wet scrubbing  
- Water pump for controlled mopping  
- Powered by 12V Li-ion battery, driven by L298N motor driver  

## 🧠 Components
Arduino Mega, Ultrasonic Sensor, IR Sensors (×3), L298N Motor Driver,  
HC-05 Bluetooth Module, Relay Modules, Vacuum Motor, Mop Motor, Water Pump.
